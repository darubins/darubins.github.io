	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm <span itemprop="name">David Rubinstein</span>. I'm an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.sdmesa.edu/academics/v2/programs/mathematics/">Mesa College</a>.</p>

	<p> I am interested in mathematics education research and in equitable course-redesign through the use of active and project based learning. In my courses I strive to create opportunities for my students to directly engage with the material and to incorporate real world applications throughout the presentation of new topics. </p>

		For more information about me, (and for pics of my toothless dog Lala!) see the <a href="/aboutme"> About me tab </a>). For a more thorough description of my research, and to view my publications and presentations, click on the <a href="/research"> Research Tab </a>).  I have linked many interesting blogs, notes and resources in my <a href="/links">Links tab</a>- most are math related, but there are a lot of fun Yiddish resources there as well.
