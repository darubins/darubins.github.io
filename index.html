	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm <span itemprop="name">David Rubinstein</span>, a fourth-year graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am working under <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>.</p>

	<p>My research is in the field of Tensor Triangular Geometry. I am currently researching questions related to the structure of various derived categories of motives over algebraically closed fields.

		<br><br>
		Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics.

		For more information about me, (and for pics of my toothless dog Lala!) see the About me tab (or click <a href="/aboutme"> here </a>). For a more thorough description of my research, and to view my publications and presentations, click on the Research Tab (or click <a href="/research"> here </a>). There are many exciting seminars and departmental programs active at UCSC right now: for my involvement in them, click on the <a href="/activities"> Activities tab </a>. I have linked many interesting blogs, notes and resources in my <a href="/links">Links tab</a>- most are math related, but there are some fun Yiddish recourses there as well.
