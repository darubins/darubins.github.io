	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm <span itemprop="name">David Rubinstein</span>. I'm an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.sdmesa.edu/academics/v2/programs/mathematics/">Mesa College</a> . Previously I was a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My advisor was <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>.</p>

	<p> I am interested in mathematics education research and in equitable course-redesign through the use of active and project based learning. In my courses I strive to create opportunities for my students to directly engage with the material and to incorporate real world applications throughout the presentation of new topics. </p>

		<br><br>
		Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics.

		For more information about me, (and for pics of my toothless dog Lala!) see the <a href="/aboutme"> About me tab </a>). For a more thorough description of my research, and to view my publications and presentations, click on the <a href="/research"> Research Tab </a>). There are many exciting seminars and departmental programs active at UCSC right now: for my involvement in them, click on the <a href="/activities"> Activities tab </a>. I have linked many interesting blogs, notes and resources in my <a href="/links">Links tab</a>- most are math related, but there are a lot of fun Yiddish resources there as well.
