	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm <span itemprop="name">David Rubinstein</span>, a fifth-year graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am working under <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>.</p>

	<p>My research is in the field of Tensor Triangular Geometry. I am currently researching questions related to the structure of various `large' derived categories of motives

		<br><br>
		Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics. 
		<br><br>

		For more information about me, (and for pics of my toothless dog Lala!) see the <a href="/aboutme"> About me tab </a>). For a more thorough description of my research, and to view my publications and presentations, click on the <a href="/research"> Research Tab </a>). There are many exciting seminars and departmental programs active at UCSC right now: for my involvement in them, click on the <a href="/activities"> Activities tab </a>. I have linked many interesting blogs, notes and resources in my <a href="/links">Links tab</a>- most are math related, but there are a lot of fun Yiddish resources there as well.
