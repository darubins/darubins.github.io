	<p class="lead">Hello! I'm <span itemprop="name">David Rubinstein</span>, a fourth-year graduate student in mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am working under <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>.</p>

	<p>My research interests include all things tensor triangular in nature, with an emphasis on what is visable at the level of Tensor Triangular Geometry. 

		<br><br>
		Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics.
