<p>Previously I completed my PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics. </p>
