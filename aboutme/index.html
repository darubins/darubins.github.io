<div class="row">
<p>In 2024, I completed my PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics. </p>

.image-group {
    display: flex; /* Align images horizontally */
    gap: 10px; /* Space between images */
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Wrap images to the next line if they don't fit */
    margin-top: 15px; /* Space above the group */
    justify-content: flex-start; /* Align images to the left (can be changed) */
}

.image-group img {
    width: 150px; /* Set a consistent width for all images */
    height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
    border-radius: 8px; /* Optional: rounded corners for a polished look */
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Optional: subtle shadow */
}

<p>In my free time I like to: 
	<ul>
		<li>Cook/Bake! Some selected favorites of mine include: Challah (pronounced Khallah), Carrot Cake, Pizza (in my little ooni oven), Kugel, and tacos de papa.

                    <img src="pics/Long Khallah.JPG" alt="Carrot Cake">
                    <img src="pics/pizza.JPG" alt="Homemade Pizza">
            </div>
        </li>
		<li>Make homebrew! I have a small little homebrew setup that is fun to mess around with.</li>
		<li>Read! In particular I am a big advocate for Yiddish literature (so much has been translated into English) and have many suggestions for people to read if anyone is interested! </li>
		<li> Spend time with my lovely wife <a href="https://www.sdhumane.org/programs/veterinary-medicine/internships.html"> Yaneli </a> and our <a href= "Lala"/> silly looking, toothless Cocker Spaniel Lala</a>.</li>
	</ul>
