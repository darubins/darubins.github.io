<div class="row">
<p>Previously I completed my PhD at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/"> Beren Sanders</a>. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, as well as a minor in Physics. </p>
<br><br>
<p>In my free time I like to: 
	<ul>
		<li>Cook/Bake! Some selected favorites of mine include: Challah (pronounced Khallah), Carrot Cake, Pizza (in my little ooni oven), Kugel, and tacos de papa. </li>
		<li>Make homebrew! I have a small little homebrew setup that is fun to mess around with.</li>
		<li>Read! In particular I am a big advocate for Yiddish literature (so much has been translated into English) and have many suggestions for people to read if anyone is interested! </li>
		<li> Spend time with my lovely wife <a href="https://www.sdhumane.org/programs/veterinary-medicine/internships.html"> Yaneli </a> and our <a href= "Lala"/> silly looking, toothless Cocker Spaniel Lala</a>.</li>
	</ul>
